## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Widget configurations
widget_configs (site_id, config JSONB, created_at, updated_at)

-- Internal webhook events
webhook_events_internal (id, event_type, site_id, session_id, page_data, utm_data, custom_data, visitor_data, session_data, should_trigger_ai, ai_triggered, created_at)

-- Teaser messages
teaser_messages (id, site_id, session_id, message, priority, consumed, expires_at, created_at)

-- Teaser polling tracking
teaser_polls (id, site_id, session_id, page_data, utm_data, custom_data, created_at)
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET/POST /api/config/[siteId]` - Widget configuration management
- `POST /api/internal-webhook` - Event processing and AI triggering
- `GET /api/internal-webhook` - Dashboard event retrieval
- `POST/PUT /api/teaser-messages` - Real-time message system
- `POST /api/webhook-utm` - Legacy webhook support

### Core Files
- `chat-widget-nuclear.js` - Main widget implementation (1060 lines)
- `webhook-dashboard.html` - Real-time monitoring dashboard
- `api/internal-webhook.js` - Event processing and AI logic
- `api/teaser-messages.js` - Real-time messaging system

## 🚧 Current Blockers & Issues

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
**BLOCK-002**: Session ID mismatch between console logs and dashboard events  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS 🔄  
**Assigned**: Development Team  
**Description**: Widget generating multiple different session IDs for each event, causing teaser messages to be sent to wrong session  
**Root Cause**: Session ID was generated at END of initialization, allowing multiple initialization attempts to create different session IDs  
**Solution Attempted**: Moved session ID generation to START of setup() function, only generate once per page load  
**Current Status**: Session ID now generates once, but need to verify all events use same session ID  
**Impact**: Teaser messages fail to reach client because session ID mismatch  

**BLOCK-001**: Polling initialization not starting consistently  
**Status**: RESOLVED ✅  
**Assigned**: Development Team  
**Description**: Widget was initializing twice due to autoInit() race condition, causing polling to be configured then overwritten  
**Root Cause**: autoInit() called immediately AND on DOMContentLoaded, plus manual setup() calls  
**Solution**: Fixed initialization sequence, added race condition protection, improved error handling  
**Impact**: Manual teaser messages now display in real-time consistently  

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
None currently identified.

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY
None currently identified.
